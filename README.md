About car sharing
Car sharing is when two or more people travel together by car for all or part of a trip. The passengers usually make a contribution towards the driver’s fuel costs.

Car sharing may be formal, using an organised car share scheme, or informal – for example, friends or colleagues travelling to work together.

How to car share
There are a number of easy ways to car share:

you could set up an informal arrangement with family, friends or colleagues
some organisations or businesses arrange car sharing for their employees – ask if this is available where you work
there are organised schemes available to everyone which operate over the internet, including Liftshare(external link opens in a new window / tab) 
Remember that your personal security should be a key part of any car share arrangement.

Even if you don’t drive, you can still car share. Many car drivers would be willing to share a car to work if there was someone suitable to travel with.

Park and Share
If a straightforward lift share won’t work for you, why not consider Park and Share? Take your car or public transport from home to a central destination where you meet up with other car sharers to finish your journey.

You can find more information on the Park and Share page. 

The benefits of car sharing
The benefits of car sharing include:

reduced fuel costs and parking fees
increased personal security - company when you walk to and from the car park
better air quality and lower carbon emissions due to reduced traffic fumes
less congestion and shorter journeys due to fewer cars being on the road
an increased chance of finding a parking space, because fewer cars means less competition for spaces
journeys being more pleasant due to having company
Car sharing tips
Take a look at these tips for car sharing:

always confirm the time, date and price of your car share journey before the actual journey takes place
exchange contact details with your car share – it makes life much simpler if you can give them a call to check or rearrange any details
if you are the car sharing driver, you should check with your insurance company that you are covered to carry passengers
don’t smoke in somebody else’s car without asking their permission first
check if it’s okay to bring food and drink on the journey and to consume them in the car
don’t be late: if you're car sharing it’s important to be on time, as it’s not just yourself but potentially three or four other people that you will be holding back
keep an open mind: some people like to chat, some prefer to commute quietly (be prepared to make small talk or alternatively to listen to the radio)
The more people talk about car sharing, the more people will be encouraged to do it. The more people that car share, the fewer cars on the road, meaning less traffic, less congestion, and quicker journey times.
